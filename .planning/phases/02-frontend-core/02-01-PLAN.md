<objective>
Set up Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand state management, TypeScript types, and Ontario Works form data.

Purpose: Establish the frontend foundation that form components and chat panel will build upon.
Output: Working Next.js app with configured store and form data ready for UI development.

    Create Next.js 14 project with App Router in frontend/ directory:

    1. Run `npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --no-turbopack` with these answers:
       - TypeScript: Yes
       - ESLint: Yes
       - Tailwind CSS: Yes
       - src/ directory: Yes
       - App Router: Yes
       - Turbopack: No (use webpack for stability)
       - Import alias: @/*

    2. After creation, update frontend/.env.local:
       ```
       NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
       ```

    3. Update frontend/src/app/page.tsx to a simple placeholder:
       ```tsx
       export default function Home() {
         return (
           <main className="min-h-screen p-8">
             <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">FormBridge</h1>
             <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">Ontario Works Application Assistant</p>
           </main>
         );
       }
       ```

    4. Install additional dependencies:
       ```bash
       cd frontend && npm install zustand lucide-react
       ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    cd frontend && npm run dev -- --port 3000 &
    sleep 5
    curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -q "FormBridge"
    pkill -f "next dev"
  </verify>
  <done>
    Next.js dev server starts on port 3000, page displays "FormBridge" title with Tailwind styling (blue text)

    frontend/src/types/index.ts
    frontend/src/store/formStore.ts
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create frontend/src/types/index.ts with all TypeScript interfaces:

    ```typescript
    // Form structure types
    export interface FormTemplate {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      description: string;
      sections: FormSection[];
    }

    export interface FormSection {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      description?: string;

    }

    export interface FormQuestion {

      commonConfusions: string[];
      relatedQuestions: string[];
    }

    // Chat types
    export interface ChatMessage {
      role: 'user' | 'assistant';
      content: string;
      suggestedAnswer?: string;
      confidence?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
      timestamp: number;
    }

    // Store types
    export interface FormState {
      // Form answers
      answers: Record<string, string | number | boolean>;
      setAnswer: (fieldId: string, value: string | number | boolean) => void;

      // Active question for chat
      activeQuestionId: string | null;
      setActiveQuestion: (id: string | null) => void;

      // Conversations per question

      markSectionComplete: (sectionId: string) => void;

      // Reset
      reset: () => void;
    }
    ```

    2. Create frontend/src/store/formStore.ts with Zustand store:

    ```typescript
    import { create } from 'zustand';
    import { FormState, ChatMessage } from '@/types';

    const initialState = {
      answers: {},
      activeQuestionId: null,
      conversations: {},
      sessionId: null,
      completedSections: [],
    };

    export const useFormStore = create<FormState>((set) => ({
      ...initialState,

      setAnswer: (fieldId: string, value: string | number | boolean) =>
        set((state) => ({
          answers: { ...state.answers, [fieldId]: value },
        })),

      setActiveQuestion: (id: string | null) =>
        set({ activeQuestionId: id }),

      addMessage: (questionId: string, message: ChatMessage) =>
        set((state) => ({
          conversations: {
            ...state.conversations,
            [questionId]: [...(state.conversations[questionId] || []), message],
          },
        })),

      setSessionId: (id: string) =>
        set({ sessionId: id }),

      markSectionComplete: (sectionId: string) =>
        set((state) => ({
          completedSections: state.completedSections.includes(sectionId)
            ? state.completedSections
            : [...state.completedSections, sectionId],
        })),

      reset: () => set(initialState),
    }));
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

    TypeScript compilation passes with no errors, types and store are properly exported
